On October 28th, we gathered in person at the largest data event in Espírito Santo, Data Saturday Vitória. With over 600 registered attendees and 30 presentations, this event was the premier opportunity of the year to connect, gain insights, and learn about new technologies and tools from leading data professionals across the country and peers from various companies.

During the event, I presented a talk on "Implementing the CQRS Pattern with Azure SQL" to professionals from different fields. This presentation provided practical knowledge and showcased how Azure SQL could be effectively used to implement the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern in diverse applications.
