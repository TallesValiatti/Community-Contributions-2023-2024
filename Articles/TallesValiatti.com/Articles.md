|May 23, 2024|Using Kernel Memory — Part 1|This article is about Microsoft's Kernel Memory project, an advanced tool available on GitHub for managing data using language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP). It allows efficient and accessible data indexing and querying, even for non-technical users. Key features include data indexing, natural language queries, source tracking for transparency, and integration with LLMs. It employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine data retrieval with text generation, providing contextually rich and accurate responses|https://tallesvaliatti.com/utilizando-o-kernel-memory-parte-1-9e22e6950761|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tallesvaliatti_criando-sql-queries-com-o-semantic-kernel-activity-7182065829528682497-2OvQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop|
|Apr 19, 2024|Creating SQL Queries with Semantic Kernel — Part 2|In this second part of the series, the post will cover the creation of plugins for three key tasks: ConvertNlpToSqlPlugin, which generates a T-SQL query based on user requests; QueryDbPlugin, which executes the query in the database and returns the results as a dictionary; and FormatResponsePlugin, which uses the data from QueryDbPlugin to write the final response for the user. This guide will show how to build and integrate these plugins to efficiently handle user queries.|https://tallesvaliatti.com/criando-sql-queries-com-o-semantic-kernel-parte-2-ce345adb2a19|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tallesvaliatti_criando-sql-queries-com-o-semantic-kernel-activity-7187070861105848321-7WLG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop|
|Apr 5, 2024|Creating SQL Queries with Semantic Kernel — Part 1|This post will show how to create an agent to query a database containing product sales data. The goal is to develop an agent that can engage in fluid and continuous conversation with the user, and, when requested, create and execute SQL queries on the database. Azure Open AI will be used to power the application. The tutorial will guide you through creating the cloud resource and deployment, and saving the necessary information for integration with the Semantic Kernel.|https://tallesvaliatti.com/criando-sql-queries-com-o-semantic-kernel-parte-1-cb12c128e2ef|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tallesvaliatti_criando-sql-queries-com-o-semantic-kernel-activity-7182065829528682497-2OvQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop|
|Jan 29, 2024|Enhancing OpenAPI in .NET Minimal Web APIs|This article explores using OpenAPI to standardize and document RESTful APIs in .NET 8. OpenAPI defines API endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses using YAML or JSON, promoting clear and consistent documentation. It simplifies developer collaboration, enhances API understanding, and ensures consistent design. Key advantages include automatic documentation generation and language independence, enabling efficient interaction among diverse teams. OpenAPI's robust tool ecosystem and cross-platform support enhance API development and integration, improving interoperability and software quality.|https://tallesvaliatti.com/incrementando-o-openapi-em-minimal-web-apis-do-net-79c7ef8c3cd0|https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tallesvaliatti_incrementando-o-openapi-em-minimal-web-apis-activity-7157728364613492737-YcWY?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop|
